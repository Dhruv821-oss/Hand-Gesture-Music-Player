The Gesture Music Player is an innovative, interactive application that allows users to control their music entirely through hand gestures, without touching a keyboard or mouse. Using a standard webcam and MediaPipe’s hand tracking, the system detects specific hand gestures such as Victory (Play), Thumbs Up (Pause), Fist, Open Palm (Stop + Volume Control), and pointing gestures to skip tracks.

The app integrates real-time gesture recognition with a smooth, stable detection algorithm that ensures accidental hand movements do not trigger unwanted actions. Users can control volume dynamically by adjusting the hand’s size in the camera frame, providing a natural and intuitive music control experience.

Built with Streamlit, the app offers a live camera feed alongside status indicators showing the detected gesture, stable gesture, current action, track name, volume, and camera status. Manual controls are also included in the sidebar for full flexibility. The audio engine uses Pygame to play music from a playlist, supporting play, pause, next, previous, stop, and volume adjustments.

This project demonstrates the power of computer vision and gesture-based interaction for creative, hands-free control systems, making it ideal for futuristic smart interfaces, accessibility applications, or interactive installations.
